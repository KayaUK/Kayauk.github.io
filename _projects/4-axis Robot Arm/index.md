This was my very first robotics project, built out of pure curiosity and passion. I assembled a 3-axis robotic arm using four servo motors, with a two-finger gripper at the end-effector. The entire system was controlled manually using two joysticks, allowing full positional control over the arm and gripper. Although based on a pre-existing design, the project sparked my interest in industrial and collaborative robotics, and laid the foundation for more advanced robot arm work I'm currently developing.
