At first, I tried using a worm gear mechanism inspired by ready-made models, but the motor was underpowered and kept getting clogged. Since powerful motors are quite expensive in my country, I now realize I should have explored a different transmission method from the start.

This time, I secured it to the wall for better stability and upgraded to a more efficient gate system. My mom wasn’t happy with its appearance, and since relocating it wasn’t an option, I had to rethink the design.

As the first person to wake up in my house, I had the unglamorous job of feeding our two cats every morning. Tired of the smell and inconvenience, I decided to build my own automated cat feeder.
I began by testing off-the-shelf designs, but motors were weak and prone to jamming—plus motor prices were high in my country. To address this, I designed a worm gear-based feeding mechanism to prevent backflow and improve torque.
The first prototype was wall-mounted for stability, using a simple gate system. However, my mom didn’t like how it looked or that it couldn’t be moved—so I had to rethink the design.
The final version was redesigned in Fusion 360, using aluminum profiles for structural strength and a hidden internal gate. A sloped floor ensures smooth food flow. It’s now operated with a button, but I'm working on a WiFi-connected version for remote feeding via phone.
It not only works well—it’s mom-approved.
